# vb2007.hu-api

## About

A simple API for my personal website, written with Express.js and some other packages.

This project was made for replacing the first version of my site that was written in PHP for some weird, masochist reason: [vb2007.hu-php](https://github.com/vb2007/vb2007.hu-php)

## Setting up the application

### General setup

**A MongoDB database is required for running the application:**

- [OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)
- [MongoDB 4.4 on Raspberry Pi 4 with Debian 13](./docs/db/mongodb-pi4-deb13-setup.md)

1. Clone the repository.
2. Based on the use-case, follow the [Dev Setup](./docs/dev-setup.md) or the [Prod Setup](./docs/prod-setup.md) guide.
